Unfortunately for now, when you make changes to your airtable project (not just the data but columns, types, names, etc.) these changes can't be automatically replicated to Voltapp.

To do so, you will have to use the **Refresh** button into your Airtable node. By doing so, depending on which changes you made, you might have to re-create some of your airtable actions within your graphs.
